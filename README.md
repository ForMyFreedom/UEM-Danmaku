# UEM-Danmaku
A test game to know more about the Godot Mono Engine, using references of my college, UEM,  to make a game 'Danmaku-like' (I know well that regular Danmaku isn't this way... But just belive that is!)

## wtf is this? 
You think i know? Pff

No, just kidding, this 'game' is about the jorney of an regular _BCC Student_ (Know as 'Brimeiro Comando da Capital' to the more wisdowests...). A journey about discovery. Sacrife, and knucles... Just beat the shit out of all Enemys (In this alpha, is just the inconstant but aggressive **Low Internet**, and the slow but unstoppablee **Big Project**) while you get away from then. This way you will gain powerfull alies know as Invocations (The professors of my college...) 

## Controls 
Just the Arrows to movement and the Z and X to use the two invocations of this alpha (You start with nothing, then, good lucky to dodge!)

When you die during combat, you can press 'R' to restart.

Evertime you ended a scene (Like winning/lose a combat or adquiring a new invocation), press 'Enter' to continue.
